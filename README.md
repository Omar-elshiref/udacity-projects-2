## Landing Page Project

### Project Description
This project is a dynamic **Landing Page** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates manipulation of the DOM by programmatically building a navigation menu, highlighting sections in view, and adding smooth scrolling interactions between the sections of the page. The page includes multiple sections, and the navigation menu is automatically updated as new sections are added, making the project flexible and scalable.

### Features
- **Dynamic Navigation Menu:** The navigation bar is generated dynamically based on the sections in the page.
- **Scroll to Section:** Clicking on a navigation link smoothly scrolls to the relevant section of the page.
- **Active Section Highlighting:** The section currently in the viewport is highlighted as active, improving the user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The page layout is fully responsive and adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the landing page.
3. Scroll through the sections and click on the navigation links to jump to different sections.
4. As you scroll, the section visible in the viewport will automatically be highlighted in the navigation bar and on the page itself.
